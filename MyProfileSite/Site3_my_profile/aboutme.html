                    So my name is Barzin and i live in Holland.
                    My hobbies are mostly reading (screen 💻reading so no books📚) different topics but mostly
                    development and IT related subjects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also enjoy listening to music🎶(very different genres) and cooking 🍝🍕🍜🫕 (experimently or
                    the ones i know 😎).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides reading i try to take walks🚶(no specifiek route😅), throughout the day and watch some
                    movies 📽️(mostly during dinner 🍕🍳😁).
                </p>

                    After high school I've studied (MBO ICT) which is a job preparational college.
                    After that i went to HBO Technical Information (which is like university for getting your
                    bachlors degree).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside my studies, i've always worked (sometimes parttime and some periods fulltime) at different
                    companies.
                    The majority of my career has been IT and Technic related. But i've done some development in the
                    past too (some c#.net and some PHP).

                <h1 class="content_titles">Current and future plans</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Currently</strong> i've started a new challenge which is learning to become a Fullstack
                    Development.
                    The reason is because i always was attrackted to programming and love to right code and think of
                    ways to automate a process or just create new ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To become a full stack developer, i've joined a online school called 'Winc Academy' where i start
                    learning Front-end development and then proceed to Backend development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to this new challenge i already started learning some basics of Python programming, which will
                    help me when i get to the Backend part of the curriculum of current study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've already put my exercises and projects on Github. In coming period and in <strong>the
                        future</strong>
                    i will put most of my projects on this site and also make sure that the code and assest of each
                    project can be seen, followed or downloaded via my Github.
                </p>
