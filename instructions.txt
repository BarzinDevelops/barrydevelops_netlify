Exercise - CSS Box Model
Introduction
You will use the Box Model properties on the elements of your website. Maybe you've even already done so before when you gave your borders a color.

Part 1:
Grab a pen and paper and draw the box-model.
No, seriously, draw it. It will help you understand.

Part 2:
- Give all semantic elements (<main>, <header>) a nice colored border.
    use margin to make all the elements on the page have a nice-looking distance from each other. Not too close, but not too far away either.
- Make sure the padding on text elements is good.
    Use different padding for top & bottom, and for left & right. First, use the extensive CSS notation, then the "shorthand" notation. i.e.: padding: top, right, bottom, left.
    
- Center an element using margin: 0 auto. Use your references and Google
    The centered element needs margin and another property to be able to center itself. Do you know what property? *See answer below.

Part 3: inline vs block-level elements
Some HTML elements have default values for box-model properties. For example, an <h1> element has default margins. As such, any HTML element is always by default either a block-level element or an inline element.

block-level element: An element that behaves as a page-wide block.

inline element: An element that behaves as a part of a paragraph, only taking up the width it requires.

Block vs inline

To do:

-  Add a list to your <nav>, through a <ul>
    Make each <li> have a link to a different page
    Use the CSS display property to make the list horizontal instead of vertical. You can read more about the display property and how to use it here.
When using the element selector, you will see that all the lists on your page are not horizontal. Use a class selector to only affect the ul in the navigation.
